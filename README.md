# Pomodoro timer
## 📌 Description
A simple and customizable Pomodoro timer application to help you manage your time effectively.
The Pomodoro Timer is a productivity tool based on the Pomodoro Technique. It allows you to set work intervals, short breaks, and long breaks to improve focus and efficiency. The application is built using Python and Tkinter for the user interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### ✅ Prerequisites
- `Python 3.13` or higher
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`):
- Tested on Windows.

### 📥 Installation and run
1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (I advise using `uv`)
3. Install dependencies (you can use `requirements.txt`)
4. Run the application (you can use the provided `run.bat` file)
5. Use the graphical interface to configure work and break intervals, start the timer, and manage your sessions.

## 💡 Usage
Once the application is running, you will see a simple graphical interface with the following features:
- Work Interval: Set the duration of your work session (typically 25 minutes, but customizable)
- Short Break: Set the duration for short breaks (typically 5 minutes)
- Long Break: Set the duration for long breaks (typically 15 minutes, after several Pomodoros)

## ❓ Help
If you encounter issues, ensure:
- Python 3.13 or higher is installed.
- Dependencies are correctly installed.
